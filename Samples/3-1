You tap your feet to the music and forget that these are animals. Overworked and under-appreciated housewives, sons who do not wish to follow their father's footsteps, daughters so shy their talent remains hidden... You have seen these people in your lives. To watch an anthropomorphic film makes those familiar hurts less painful. The film deals with these emotions with very light, deft strokes.

Very small children may not find too much in the film that will keep them engaged, because the treatment of the film is rather adult. And grown up kids may not find the choice of songs like Leonard Cohen's 'Hallelujah', 'Girl From Ipanema' on Saxophone, or Paul Anka's 'My Way' (made huge by Sinatra) to their liking. Yes, Ash does compose and sing 'Freedom' but the choice of songs still seems a tad more for grown ups with a sense of nostalgia rather than young and hip. In fact, the little kids this generation are not even listening to 'Call Me Maybe'

The most fun parts are the auditions of course! The Japanese 'Kira Kira Killer' and 'Koi Koi Koi' performed for a group that refuses to go away, and the lone sheep belting out, 'Baaaaayyybeee' from Seal's 'Kiss From A Rose' make you smile and you feel in sync when Rosita discovers her inner dancer when she hears Gypsy Kings sing 'Bamboleo'.

The plot is predictable, but the songs and the way the plot unfolds holds movie magic. What else is there?
