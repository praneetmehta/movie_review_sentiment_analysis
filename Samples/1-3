No Orchids for Miss Blandish, a British gangster film adapted from the novel by James Hadley Chase, received a very hostile reception from the press. This was mainly due to the film's high (for the time) level of sexual and violent content, but also because its attempt to portray Americans using a largely British cast (including an early role for Sid James)[5] was seen as unconvincing.[6] The British film journal Monthly Film Bulletin called it, "..the most sickening exhibition of brutality, perversion, sex and sadism ever to be shown on a cinema screen."[6] The Sunday Express film reviewer called No Orchids for Miss Blandish "the worst film I have ever seen."[7] The Australian newspaper The Age also gave a harsh review: "No Orchids for Miss Blandish is not only a disgrace to the studio that made it, but it also reflects on the British industry as a whole...the entire production is unpardonable."[8] Cliff Goodwin, discussing No Orchids For Miss Blandish's initial reception, notes it was "unanimously dubbed 'the worst film ever made'."[5] Later reviews of the film were equally antipathetic. No Orchids for Miss Blandish was described by British film historian Leslie Halliwell as a "hilariously awful gangster film...one of the worst films ever made."[7] Leonard Maltin's Classic Movie Guide states "No Orchids for Miss Blandish misses by a mile."[9]
