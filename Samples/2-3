If you have been a gamer, and have followed Kate Beckinsale through the five movies, you'd also be gasping in awe because she remains just as gorgeous as she was in the first film. And with every consecutive film she acquires more skills. Theo James looks like the eye candy he always was and plays David with enough emotion and angst that could be expected in a blood and gore film.

The leather clad Vampires and the shabbily dressed Lycans have many encounters. There is blood and bodies pile up faster than you can say Vampire. But their coven is full of traitors and machinations for power and that is rather satisfying indeed. It is not an intellectual exercise and no one is pretending that it is, so the length of the movie also seems just right.

The all pervading blue-grey world in Budapest or some such East European city keeps you in the mood for intrigue. The Goth costumes are as interesting as in the movies before and you smile when you see the Vampires raise a toast of red wine... Or is it blood?

The Lycans on the other hand are grungy and their headquarters are in a train yard... But their leader is creepy and horrific and he does make your heart skip a beat the first time he transmogrifies into a beast.

The camerawork is amazing when the story takes us to the snow-clad North. The mountains and the train traveling through the white snow are beautifully shot. Of course there is more blood spilt here, but you end up saying, 'Good fun!'

Of course you miss the deeper intrigue as you have seen before in the shape of Viktor, and you wish the traitors weren't so easy to spot in this film. But the last fight between Marius and Selene is so good, your blood lust is satisfied too.
